# LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy Helm Chart

A helm chart to ease deployment of the [LaunchDarkly Relay Proxy](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay) to Kubernetes.

## LaunchDarkly overview

[LaunchDarkly](https://www.launchdarkly.com) is a feature management platform that serves over 100 billion feature flags daily to help teams build better software, faster. [Get started](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/getting-started) using LaunchDarkly today!

## Installation

```shell
helm repo add launchdarkly-ld-relay https://launchdarkly.github.io/ld-relay-helm
helm install ld-relay launchdarkly-ld-relay/ld-relay
```

This command will deploy the relay proxy to the Kubernetes cluster using the default configuration. The default configuration is insufficient to have a working instance of the proxy running. You must minimally provide an environment for the proxy to connect to. See the configuration section below.

## Configuration options

This chart can be customized by overriding the configuration options defined in [the values file](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay-helm/blob/main/values.yaml). You are encouraged to review this file as it contains detailed documentation. The list of value options are also summarized below.

The relay proxy is controlled through environment variables. These can be set directly by specifying a name and value in the `relay.environment` option, or through a secret using the `relay.secrets` option. See the [relay proxy's guide on configuration](https://github.com/launchdarkly/ld-relay/blob/v6/docs/configuration.md#file-section-environment-name) for a list of valid environment variable names

## Testing

The unit tests start with a base set of comparison files referred to as "golden files". These should represent an
identical match to the installed chart if only the default values are used. Starting from this base point allows us to
force additional unit tests only on the properties we expect to change.

Golden files can be updated by running `make update-golden-files`.
Unit tests are run with `make test`.

> **NOTE** The testing structure drew heavy inspiration from [this blog post](https://camunda.com/blog/2022/03/test/).

## About LaunchDarkly

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs) for a complete list.
